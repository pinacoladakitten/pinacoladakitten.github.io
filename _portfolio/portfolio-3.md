General gameplay showcase for the game, you can swap between 'different forms' in which each has 2 magics you can cast and a different weapon. Not all forms were finished of course, but the general idea is still there. I wanted each form to sort of have their own 'playstyle' associated with them, or you can mix up how you would use them.
