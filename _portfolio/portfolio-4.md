title: "Swish Cloud (2016)"
excerpt: "An old game I developed and released for the iOS app store, made in GameMaker:Studio in which you play as a cloud and dodge spikes. There are also additional characters that have their own unique gimmiks. Not on the store anymore due to it costing 100 bucks per year, thanks Apple. :') <br/><img src='/images/SwishCloud/swishCloud.PNG'>"
