**(Music from DMC, NiGHTS, and Kingdom Hearts)**
This video basically showcases the capabilities of bosses I can design for the game, (NOTE: the mechanics/movesets of each boss will most likely change in the future as well). I was mainly inspired by
the Dark Souls series and Kingdom Hearts in how their bosses worked, and I plan to add even more 'unexpected machanics' for bosses in the future. These are mainly for 'testing the waters'.

**(Music from FFXIV)**
Here we have a small look at some 'overworld platforming' by scaling the various wreckage of castles in 'The Desert Heap' overworld. I plan to add more of these 'obscure' pathways at which you can freely
climb using your magical abilities to find 'interesting areas'. This game has a large emphasis on 'platforming' and 'action-based combat', and so I designed various spells/abilities to be used for both 
scenarios in some way. Some may seem obvious in their usage, while others might not be so.
