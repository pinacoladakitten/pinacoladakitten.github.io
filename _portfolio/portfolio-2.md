A small showcase of how the overworld and combat scenarios looked for the game. The original intention of the game was the make something similar to Final Fantasy, but you have the ability to dodge attacks. Now it's become something a bit more than that...(NOTE: elements of the combat sections are pretty outdated in this video.)

A showcase of a super-boss I designed for the game which showcases the capabilities the game has in terms of its mechanics. I really focused on making this boss 'movement-based' since I added the movement system just before creating this one. It goes to show the extent to which bosses can have interesting abilities to use against you.

I originally designed this boss before I had added the movement system into the game's combat, however it still seems to work well here I think. This was the first 'real-boss' I made for the game, and I'm really happy with how it turned out.
