Hey all! Here's a bit about myself. My name's Anna, I'm a self-taught Programmer, 3D Modeler/Animator, and overall Game Developer/Designer. I also attended RCC and UCR as a Computer Science major to learn more about programming as well. Currently I'm working on multiple personal game development projects with a friend who makes music and sound effects, with my largest and most active project being, 'Potato Mage: Belfry Of The Ultima' made in Unreal Engine 4! I'm super excited to release this project someday as it's basically something I'm exceedingly passionate in developing. 

In the past I've been apart of a number of modding communities including: (mainly)-Sonic Generations, Devil May Cry 4, Dungeon Defenders, Don't Starve, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, and Monster Hunter World. After modding, I then moved onto game development to start creating my own games, starting in GameMaker:Studio, and eventually developing the first iteration of Potato Mage in it (largest project at the time). However, that project turned into something I just couldn't continue with. I then picked up Unreal 4 and now I'm here with the development of my current project. I'm also trying to learn Unity on the side as well. Thanks :)
