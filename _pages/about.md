Hey all! Here's a bit about myself. My name's Anna, I'm 23, and I'm a self-taught Programmer, 3D Modeler/Animator, and overall game developer/designer. However, 
I also have some education from attending RCC and UCR as a Computer Science major. Currently I'm working on multiple personal game development projects with 
a friend who makes music and sound effects, with my largest and most active project being, 'Potato Mage: Belfry Of The Ultima' made in Unreal Engine 4! I'm
super excited to release this project someday as it's basically a project I'm exceedingly passionate in developing. Anyway, in the past I've been apart of a 
number of modding communities including: (mainly) Sonic Generations, Devil May Cry 4, Dungeon Defenders, Don't Starve, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, and Monster Hunter World. 
From these I've learned quite a lot of information about how games work, and from creating my own custom mods I've basically developed my skills as well. After modding, I 
then moved onto game development to start creating my own games, starting in GameMaker: Studio, and eventually developing the first iteration of Potato Mage in
it. Let's just say, that project was a failure I just couldn't continue, so I immediately jumped into Unreal 4 and now I'm here with developing my current project.
I'm also trying to learn Unity on the side as well. Anyway, this summary about me has kind of gone on for a while now, so I'll just leave it off here. Thanks! :)
